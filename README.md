# Lumos: AI-Driven Keyword Optimization Tool for Assisting Conceptual Design

Code for Paper *AI-Driven Keyword Optimization Tool for Assisting Conceptual Design.*

> **Abstract**: AI drawing tools, relying on high-quality prompts to guide and refine the creative process, offer the potential to enhance efficiency and quality in the conceptual design stage. However, addressing AI's inherent accuracy issues is crucial. To tackle this challenge, our study explores the efficiency and usability of integrating AI drawing with prompt optimization tools and introduces a GPT-based prompt optimization tool for validation. Our experiments reveal that, during the concept design's divergent thinking stage, both junior and senior designers using this tool reduced their average time consumption by 35.6% and 21.6%, respectively. Expertâ€™s evaluation data of available images reveals higher image selection rates after keyword optimization with this tool compared to images generated using natural language. These findings underscore the tool's potential to boost productivity and improve the usability of generated images. It expands designers' imaginative boundaries and enhances their ability to leverage AI for streamlined workflows.
